    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken carbonara pasta bake is the perfect Sunday dinner choice for the whole family. Serve with a side of roasted vegetables, a salad, and some crusty bread to soak up extra sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces diced pancetta</li>
        <li>16 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 cups grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook pancetta in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until lightly browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Boil spaghetti in lightly salted water for 5 minutes. Drain pasta and reserve 2 cups pasta water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add egg yolks to a large mixing bowl and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour 1 1/2 cups hot pasta water over egg yolks, whisking vigorously, making sure to whisk constantly so eggs do not scramble.</li>
        <li>Whisk in Parmesan cheese, then heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta, pancetta, and chicken to the sauce, toss to combine. Transfer pasta mixture to prepared dish.</li>
        <li>Bake until hot and sauce has thickened, 20 minutes, stirring halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, stir and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes allowing sauce to continue to thicken. Additional pasta water can be added, as desired, for a saucier pasta.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
