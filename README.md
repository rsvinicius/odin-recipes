# Odin-Recipes
Welcome to the Odin-Recipes project!

## Project Overview
This project started as a basic recipe website, primarily focusing on honing HTML skills. Now, it's time to give it a visual upgrade by incorporating CSS.

## What to Expect
- **Styling with CSS**: In this phase of the project, we will be adding CSS to make the website visually appealing. We'll explore various properties like color, background color, and typography to enhance the user experience.

- **External CSS Method**: We'll be utilizing the external CSS method, separating our styling from the HTML for better maintainability.

## Experiment and Learn
This phase is all about practice and learning. Don't worry about creating a visually stunning website just yet; the primary goal is to get familiar with writing CSS and understanding how different properties work.

## Future Steps
Once we've added CSS, we'll have a foundation to make the website more visually appealing and potentially add more interactive elements.
