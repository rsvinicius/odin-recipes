# Odin-Recipes
Welcome to the Odin-Recipes project!

## Project Overview
This project is all about honing our HTML skills by creating a basic recipe website. The website will have a main index page that links to a few recipes. We're not focusing on styling at this stage; the primary goal is to strengthen our HTML foundations.

## What to Expect
HTML Proficiency: By the end of this project, we will have demonstrated a strong grasp of HTML, including structuring web content and creating functional links.

Content First: We're embracing a content-first approach. The website may not be visually stunning, but it will be rich in recipes!

## Future Improvements
Keep in mind that this project is a starting point. We'll revisit it in the future to add CSS styling, making it look more appealing. For now, our priority is the structure and content.
